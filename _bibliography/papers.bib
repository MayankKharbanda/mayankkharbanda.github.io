	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful in learning
						 rich network representations that aid the performance
						 of downstream tasks. However, recent studies showed
						 that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks
						 involving node injection and network perturbation.
						 Among these, node injection attacks are more practical
						 as they do not require manipulation in the existing
						 network and can be performed more realistically. In
						 this paper, we propose a novel problem statement — a
						 class-specific poison attack on graphs in which the
						 attacker aims to misclassify specific nodes in the
						 target class into a different class using node
						 injection. Additionally, nodes are injected in such a
						 way that they camouflage as benign nodes. We propose
						 NICKI, a novel attacking strategy that utilizes an
						 optimization-based approach to sabotage the
						 performance of GNN-based node classifiers. NICKI works
						 in two phases — it first learns the node
						 representation and then generates the features and
						 edges of the injected nodes. Extensive experiments and
						 ablation studies on four benchmark networks show that
						 NICKI is consistently better than four baseline
						 attacking strategies for misclassifying nodes in the
						 target class. We also show that the injected nodes are
						 properly camouflaged as benign, thus making the
						 poisoned graph indistinguishable from its clean
						 version w.r.t various topological properties.}
